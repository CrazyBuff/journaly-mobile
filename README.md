# Prototype app built during Unihack 2024
Initially planned to be coded as a web app. However, at around the 20 hour mark we pivoted to React Native for a mobile application.

## Tech Stack
- React Native expo
- Mapbox api
- NodeJS (planned)
- AWS MongoDB (planned)
- AWS S3 (planned)

## How to run
- Clone repository
- install Expo CLI
- build native code through expo
- (for android) download apk to run on device
- run build on ios or android emulator
